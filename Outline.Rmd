* Trying to replicate - but no data. 

* Normally distributed random number generator -> Theoretical numbers for values
    - Deriving variables from this distribution.
    - ensures stochasticity

* Using the Monte Carlo formula given in the paper. 

* Choosing a different disease - finding its quanta
    - 
    - 

* Change values of variables - bigger/smaller room, dif # of infected, etc.
