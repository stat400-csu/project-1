      Source Paper

  * Modeling the progression of COVID-19 cases/fatalities during first
    few months of pandemic
  * Predicting the progression of these cases into the future including:
      o Flex date (inflection point = rate of new cases decelerates)
      o Date of substantial reduction in cases (less than 100 new cases)


      Scope of the source paper

  * Italy and China
  * Cases and Fatalities
  * Monte Carlo


      COVID-19 in Italy

plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2

  * Italy as leader in deaths (3-19)
  * Healthcare Shortages


      Original Italian Regression

  * Error Function: a+b erf(cx−d)a+b erf(cx−d)
  * Use of multiple models

  * Estimated Flex Date: March 25th (40 days)


      Our Italian Regression

Non-linear least squares Regression: a1+e−(b+cx)a1+e−(b+cx)

a=100,000a=100,000,  b=−10.242 b=−10.242,  c=0.294 c=0.294

      Discussion

  * Limits of NLS Regression
  * Replication (U.S.)
  * How do our flex date estimates perform?
  * Differences in lockdown procedures
  * Differences in timeline


      Limitations

  * Differences in tests provided in a single day
  * Changes over time in testing efforts
  * Changes over time in lockdown procedures
  * Effects of future lockdown procedures
